*** SUMMARY ***

XINS 1.4.0 has been released. XINS is a Java-based Web Services framework that generates Java from XML definitions. Main features in the 1.4 release include:
* Automatic communication protocol detection (SOAP, POX-RPC, XML-RPC, etc.)
* Possibility to add individual files to the generated WAR file
* Support for asynchronous requests
* Extensive 'Pet Store' demo


*** BODY ***

After 5 months of development, tuning and testing, <a href="http://xins.sourceforge.net/">XINS</a> 1.4.0 has been released. XINS is an open-source Java-based Web Services framework. It offers a simple tool for the development of distributed applications.

One of the key features that differentiates XINS from other technologies is the definition-driven approach. Write simple XML definitions and XINS will generate lots for you:

* Documentation of the specifications and implementations
* Test forms, for testing your applications with a browser
* Client-side Java code, supporting load-balancing, fail-over and time-out handling
* Web application (WAR file), compatible with servlet containers
* WSDL, for SOAP-interoperability
* Unit test code, based on JUnit
* Stubs, typically used for testing
* etc.

Another key feature is protocol independence. XINS supports several communication protocols, including SOAP, XML-RPC and POX-RPC. For each incoming request XINS automatically determines which protocol to use. With XSLT the results can be transformed to HTML or other content types. Custom protocols can be added by added a single Java class.

XINS 1.4 offers various new features over release 1.3, as well as some bug fixes. The main new features are:

* Automatic communication protocol detection.
* <a href="http://xins.sf.net/asynchronous.html">Asynchronous requests</a>
* Generation of documentation in OpenDocument format, for use by OpenOffice.org, for example.
* Support for including files (e.g. HTML) in the WAR file
* Extensive <a href="http://xins.users.mcs2.netarray.com/petstore/store/">Pet Store</a> demo

Additionally, both the compile-time performance and the runtime performance of XINS have been tuned further.

XINS is used in production systems since the end of 2002. As a stable release, XINS 1.4.0 is backwards compatible with all previous stable releases. It has been tested extensively on various Java and OS platforms, including Solaris, Linux and Windows.

-- XINS Web Service Framework 3.1 released

I've just released the version 3.1 of XINS, an open source web services framework that support REST, SOAP, XML-RPC, JSON-RPC and many other protocols.
From the specification of the API (in simple XML), XINS generates the client side code, the server side templates, the API documentation in HTML, including the test forms and in open document format (ODF).
Based the examples defined in the specification, XINS generates the unit tests, the mock and the JMeter tests.

What's new in 3.1:
<ul>
    <li>Added support for caching of the result.</li>
    <li>Added possibility to return not modified (304) with no data.</li>
    <li>Improved performance.</li>
    <li>Added JSON-RPC 2.0 calling convention.</li>
    <li>Added the result codes: _FunctionNotSpecified, _FunctionNotFound, _InvalidRequestFormat, _NotAllowed, _DisabledAPI</li>
    <li>Added possibility to handle compressed (gzip) result data.</li>
    <li>Added example with jQuery.</li>
    <li>Various bug fixes</li>
</ul>

XINS is available at <a href="http://xins.sourceforge.net">http://xins.sourceforge.net</a>.
