[ ] - Execute xins all-allinone with the network cable unplugged.
[ ] - Execute xins run-allinone and call the API also with the network cable unplugged.
[ ] - Run unit tests with Java 1.5, Java 6 and Java 7.

XSLT calling convention:
0. Do not specify whether the cache is enabled. The default is 'true', so
make sure the logs say it's indeed enabled (at INFO level). Then try it and
confirm the cache is used. That should also become apparent from the logs
(at least when DEBUG is enabled).

1. Set the cache to enabled. Make sure the logs say it's indeed enabled (at
INFO level). Then try it and confirm the cache is used. That should also
become apparent from the logs (at least when DEBUG is enabled).

2. Set the cache to disabled. Make sure the logs say it's indeed disabled
(at INFO level). Then try it and confirm the cache is not used. That should
also become apparent from the logs (at least when DEBUG is enabled).

3. Try to set the cache enabled property to an invalid value. Make sure the
initialization of the framework fails.

4. Set the XSLT template location to various valid and invalid values.

ACL:
1. Have a xins.properties file with the ACL setting:

      deny 127.0.0.1/24 *

   Start a XINS API implementation.
   Confirm that localhost is denied access.

2. Create a file called "acl.txt" in the directory where the servlet
   container is started. Put the following in it:

      # comment should be ignored
      deny 127.0.0.0/25 *
      # another comment to be ignored

3. Change the ACL setting in the xins.properties file to:

      file acl.txt;allow 127.0.0.1/24 *

   Wait until the framework re-initializes.
   Confirm that it is the rule "deny 127.0.0.5/25 *" that takes precedence
   over the rule in the xins.properties file.

4. Change the ACL setting in the acl.txt file to:

      deny 10.0.0.1 *

   Confirm that localhost is now allowed access.

No build version in web.xml:
1. Deploy any API.

2. Change the web.xml in the WAR file. Remove the XINS build version. Put it
   in the WAR file again. Deploy the API.

3. Check the log. Confirm that there is a warning in there because the XINS
   build version is not set.

Re-initialization:
* Have an API implementation with a function that takes a long time to
  re-initialize (for example, 120 seconds). Make the file reload interval
  significantly smaller, for example 6 seconds.

Confirm the following:

1. During the re-initialization, the file watcher should be suspended. The
   framework should not try to re-initialize while already in a
   re-initialization process.

2. During re-initialization, any call to the framework should return a special
   HTTP status code that indicates that no calls are handled. Test with both a
   meta-function (such as _NoOp) and with a regular function.
