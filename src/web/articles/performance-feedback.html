                                        <p>I have send an e-mail to Dan Diephouse (the developer of XFire) and 
                                        Kohsuke Kawaguchi (A Sun guru involved in JAX-WS RI) about the performance document.
                                        Here are their feedback.</p>

<pre>Frankly, that benchmark means nothing.

Other things:
* You need to let the VM warm up for at LEAST 30 seconds. I often see performance increases for up to a minute after.
* What JVM params did you run with? See the wso2 benchmark for some good JVM params. 
* Only 100 requests? You're taking a sample size of a fraction of a second. GC could kick in and throw that all off.
* A calculator example really means nothing, try some more advanced data types and xml 
* Comparing REST to SOAP is apples to oranges. At least try comparing the CXF or RI RESTful stuff 

- Dan</pre>
<p>I tried to reexecute the tests with a warm up to a minute but had 100% errors back.
Anyway I think that on the tests I executed, I let the VM warm up at least 30 seconds.</p>
<p>I also removed all the REST tests.</p>

<pre>I've installed NetBeans 6.0 beta1 freshly and created a sample 
calculator app as described in your web site. I then downloaded your 
calculator-jaxws.jmx and used it with JMeter 2.3RC4, which I just 
downloaded, too.

To get a quick experiment done, I then started Glassfish and run JMeter 
all on my laptop. This is a 2.8GHz HT-enabled Pentium 4 machine with 2GB 
memory, with two Java IDEs, browser, mail client, etc., opened.

The thing I immediately noticed is that you are measuring the latency, 
and not the throughput. This is a very bad idea when you got multiple 
threads (whose number is far larger than your physical processors) 
sending requests concurrently. You'd either want to measure the 
throughput (which is normally considered more useful), or measure the 
latency with a single thread.

When I opened your jmeter project file, I noticed that you are sending 
the request to localhost. This agrees with your document where you only 
list one system as your environment. I suppose this makes sense if you 
are measuring a single-thread latency, but if you want to measure 
throughput, you should really run the client and the server on separate 
machines.

One more thing to note is that JMeter doesn't use HTTP keep-alive, so 
each request involves in TCP connection set up and tear down. With a 
trivial payload like this, this makes a big difference.



Anyway, I run it nevertheless. I executed the test once as a warm up 
(predictably this one was slow, because of JIT and everything), and did 
it one more time. The average turn around time I got was 3ms.

Because the machine is different, I can't readily compare this with the 
numbers you reported in your documentation. However, I hope this result 
is enough to make you look twice about your measurement.

Another observation in looking at the result is that JMeter doesn't have 
a timer with good precision. The turn around time is either reported as 
0, 15, or 16, which suggests that the timer it's using only got 15ms 
precision. Given that your test run completes in something like 500ms 
total, this timer precision is unacceptably inaccurate. (And for reasons 
I'll explain later you'd have intermediate pause every 10 requests, 
which makes this precision issue even worse.)

Also, you set up the ramp up time as 1 second, which means 100ms delay 
before another thread gets created. But since you only send 10 requests 
each, as long as the avg. processing time is less than 10ms, you'll 
never actually send two concurrent requests --- it's effectively using a 
single thread to drive the test (which in some sense fixes the problem 
your benchmark.)

Yet if for whatever reason one processing takes a long time to run (a GC 
activity, another application doing some work, etc), then it causes an 
avalanche affect, which is the consequence of running multiple threads 
and measure the latency.


So in conclusion, I think your benchmark is highly questionable in its 
goal (i.e., what are you trying to measure?), its methodology (i.e., are 
you setting up things to measure what you want to measure and not 
something else), and its result.</pre>
